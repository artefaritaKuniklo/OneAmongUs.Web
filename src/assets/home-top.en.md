I always remember a sentence in "Coco": Death is not the end of life, but oblivion is. Those who have left us, perhaps somewhere, are whispering to us: "Please don't forget me."    

The traces of existence may fade with time. Old photos can lose their color, and social media accounts may disappear as the internet change. Yet, the things that influence us, that bring them back to us, are not always those that physically exist. When we suddenly recall conversations we had or places we've been, the gates of memory swing open, and their voices and smiles are as vivid as ever.  

Many of us did not meet because of geographical or professional ties, but because of our shared circumstances in life. We've come to this place we call "community".
We may have never met in person and may live thousands of miles apart, crossing the boundaries of language and nationality.
Perhaps I can't even verify their "real existence". But how would we define the boundary between reality and illusion?
Even if we are not their family members, friends, or lovers in the real world, can that friendship or affection be easily denied?
When they pass away, when that avatar never goes online again, I always have a selfish desire to find a place to commemorate them, to let them continue to exist and accompany us forward.  

That's why we built this website. Those who left our lives prematurely for various reasons, those transgender individuals and our cisgender allies, are still one of us (one among us), silently caring for and accompanying us, empowering us, and giving us the courage to live on and move forward.
Perhaps the name written on the monument in reality is not what they preferred, and it may not reflect their true identity, but we can still realize all of this in our own memorial.  

We shall meet again in a place where there is no darkness.
